Domovoy, prototyped as Maudelyn's Quest, is a narrative game where match-3 gameplay determines the protagonist's emotional state during dialogues. Thus, player choice and skill at match-3 affects the protagonist's personal arc, as well as narrative outcomes for the world they share with other characters.

Developed in two phases. I drew pixel art for visual-novel-style emotive busts for 5 characters, as well as the match-3 gems. I then made 3D assets for an entirely new set of characters and emotions for the _Domovoy_ version of the game, which we presented at the [Damage Camp 2018 Arcade](https://web.archive.org/web/20220126224836/2018.damage.camp/).

This was my first experience making character art in the style of one of my favorite game genres: visual novels. I greatly enjoyed the process, and learned the expressive limitations of facial character sprite emotion. It motivated me to play with pose and position in the my next work in this format, [Econ Artists]().
