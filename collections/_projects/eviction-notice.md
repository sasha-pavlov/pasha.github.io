Eviction Notice is a VR project about the housing crisis in Hong Kong. VR was my gateway into video game development, and my experiences working on this project remain dear to me still.

I created [count images of distinct objects, then +5 or so] 3D props for the various items occupying the tiny yet atmospheric, lived-in room that the story takes place in.

Watching my models manifest themselves into the near-perfect illusion of physical space around me was so. sick. It set me on the path that I walk today.
