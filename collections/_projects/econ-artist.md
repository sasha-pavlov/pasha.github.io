_econ artist_ is a narrative tangram puzzle game about production and profit. Players learn about the allocation of costs by fitting tangram pieces that are themselves fractally comprised of tangram-piece expenditures. The prototype explores the consequences on culture and health by the subsidization of corn production in the 19__'s.

This was studio Lychee Peach's first solo project. Despite comprising one of the smallest teams in the program, in just three months, we designed, produced, and implemented a total of 5 low-fidelity prototypes, as well as the completed playable demo that we presented to Meta in the final showcase.

Prior to my current project, *pomdate*, this was the greatest number of roles that I had played in the making of a single piece of digital media. I learned about the challenges of each kind of conceptualization, design, asset-making, writing, and production work that goes into an independent video game, as well as what it takes to align these disciplines together in the pursuit of a keen, focused, singular experience. We came away from this work with deep gratitude for each other, our peers, and our seniors, and for the collaborative roots and values of independent video game production.
